## Problem Statement

Because of such reasons we started thinking how could we make education easy,
interesting and rewarding at the same time for everyone at the lowest cost
possible.

## Solution

We often see that students share their notes and tricks with their friends and even to their classmates without any second thought. We appreciate the efforts of such students for their selfless work. So, we thought of creating a platform where thee students can share their work to a wider audience and can get rewarded for their hard work.
This will encourage students to work hard and their notes and ideas can reach a wider audience who can use it for their betterment.

## Project Description

We propose an app with the vision to bring all learners on one platform. Users
can share their work in our app in the form of image, video or pdf. Any user can
share their work and bookmark those which they like. We have even provided a
search bar to search for specific topics. For fast and secure handling of queries
between the users and the app, we are using a cloud database. To keep the
app simple yet secured, we have used google sign-in for registration. Other
than this we have also implemented an open chat space where learners can
ask or answer things.
